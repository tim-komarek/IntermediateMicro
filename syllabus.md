## Textbook
Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, Microeconomics, Worth Publishers 2013. ISBN -13: 978-1-4641-2356-6 A study guide is available for the textbook. The web site associated with the book is also a good resource.

## Administrative Procedures
**Homework**, 32% of course grade. There are 8 homework assignments. They will be graded from 0-4 (you can think of this a 0% - 4% of your overall course grade for each homework). 

It is due before the beginning of the class period. You will need to scan it with your phone using the Genius Scan App and email it to me. We will go over the assignment during the class period it is due, thus no late homework assignments will be accepted or make-ups offered.  You can send (before the class it is due) and still get full credit, even if you are not on the Zoom where we’ll go over it. 

**Tests**, 68% of course grade. There will be a total of four tests. Collectively, these will total 68% of your overall course grade. Three of these exams will be administered during the regular class time (TTH 1:30pm – 2:45pm) along with a final exam May 6: 12:30 – 3:30pm. 
* There will not be make-up exams given under any circumstances. Instead, the ‘weight’ of any missed exams will be moved to the cumulative final exam at the end of the semester.

The final exam will be a cumulative and given during the University’s pre-determined final exam time.
