## Prerequisites
Economics 202 and Math 200 or equivalent. Students who do not meet prerequisites or co requisite will be administratively withdrawn.

## Textbook
Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, Microeconomics, Worth Publishers 2013. ISBN -13: 978-1-4641-2356-6 A study guide is available for the textbook. The web site associated with the book is also a good resource.

## Administrative Procedures
**Homework**, 32% of course grade. There are 8 homework assignments. They will be graded from 0-4 (you can think of this a 0% - 4% of your overall course grade for each homework). 

It is due before the beginning of the class period. You will need to scan it with your phone using the Genius Scan App and email it to me. We will go over the assignment during the class period it is due, thus no late homework assignments will be accepted or make-ups offered.  You can send (before the class it is due) and still get full credit, even if you are not on the Zoom where we’ll go over it. 

**Tests**, 68% of course grade. There will be a total of four tests. Collectively, these will total 68% of your overall course grade. Three of these exams will be administered during the regular class time (TTH 1:30pm – 2:45pm) along with a final exam May 6: 12:30 – 3:30pm. 

* There will not be make-up exams given under any circumstances. Instead, the ‘weight’ of any missed exams will be moved to the cumulative final exam at the end of the semester.

* The final exam will be a cumulative and given during the University’s pre-determined final exam time.

## Grading Policy:
A. Final grades will be determined based upon your attendance, performance on assignments, three in-class exams, and a comprehensive final exam using the following weights:
	
Homework: 32% (8x4%) \\
In class exams: 48% (3x16%) \\
Final exam: (May 6: 12:30-3:30pm) 20% \\
Total Possible: 100% 

B. Grades will be assigned based on the following scale: \\
A  100-94 \\
A- 93-90 \\
B+ 89-87 \\
B  86-83 \\
B- 82-80 \\
C+ 79-77 \\
C  76-73 \\
C- 72-70 \\
D+ 69-67 \\
D  66-63 \\
D- 62-60 \\
F  59-0

## Attendance
This is an online / virtual course and attendance is not explicitly a part of the course grade. However, consistent attendance and engagement is important for performing well in the course. We’ll do our best, given the online format, to replicate discussions and an interactive class environment. 

## Email Communications
Please use your ODU email address in order to correspond with me via email. I will only respond to ODU email accounts. Please put Econ 304 in the subject line. \\

When you send me an email, use it as an opportunity to work on your formal written communication skills. Please do your best to compose a well-written and professional message, using complete sentences and correct grammar and punctuation. I might respond simply “Try again” for a poorly structured email. I am happy to answer questions, etc. however, I am interested in practicing professional communication.

## Withdrawals and Incomplete Grades:
Grades assigned for withdrawals are in strict compliance with university policies and an incomplete grade is only given in exceptional circumstances. See the University Schedule book for important dates regarding withdrawals. 

## Students with Disabilities:
Old Dominion University is committed to ensuring equal access to all qualified students with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Office of Educational Accessibility (OEA) is the campus office that works with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations.

If you experience a disability which will impact your ability to access any aspect of my class, please present me with an accommodation letter from OEA so that we can work together to ensure that appropriate accommodations are available to you.
	
If you feel that you will experience barriers to your ability to learn and/or testing in my class but do not have an accommodation letter, please consider scheduling an appointment with OEA to determine if academic accommodations are necessary.

The Office of Educational Accessibility is located at 1021 Student Success Center and their phone number is (757)683-4655. Additional information is available at the OEA website: [http://www.odu.edu/educationalaccessibility/](http://www.odu.edu/educationalaccessibility/)

## Academic Integrity
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.  In addition to imposing penalties ranging anywhere from a grade of F up to suspension, it is University policy to record all Academic Dishonesty convictions permanently on the student's transcript. I report all cases of academic dishonesty to the Office of Student Conduct for adjudication.
