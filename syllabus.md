## Course Description
In this course we will develop methods of microeconomic analysis beyond the principles level. Major emphasis is placed on consumer and producer behavior, market equilibrium, market failures and strategic interaction (game theory).

## Prerequisites
Economics 202. Students who do not meet prerequisites or co requisite will be administratively withdrawn.

## Textbook
Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, Microeconomics, Worth Publishers 2013. ISBN -13: 978-1-4641-2356-6 A study guide is available for the textbook. The web site associated with the book is also a good resource.

## Course Management
We will use 2 websites for course management. 

First, there is a dedicated website for this class where I will post supplementary material (lectures, videos, assignments, etc.)
https://tim-komarek.github.io/IntermediateMicro/

Second, we will use the Blackboard online course management system for posting grades. 

Finally, I will communicate with you regularly with course updates over ODU email. You will also use ODU email to turn in graded course work. 

## Administrative Procedures
**Writing Assignments**, 12% of course grade. There are 3 writing assignments this semester. They will be graded from 0-4 (you can think of this a 0% - 4% of your overall course grade for each).

**Problem Solving Assignments**, 36% of course grade. There are 9 problem solving homework assignments. These will often be handwritten with graphs and equations. I expect them to be neat and readable. They will be graded from 0-4 (you can think of this a 0% - 4% of your overall course grade for each problem solving homework). 

**Writing and problem-solving assignments are due at the end of each week on Sunday at 11:59pm.**  


**Exams**, 52% of course grade. There will be a total of three tests. Collectively, these will total 52% of your overall course grade. Two of these exams will be administered during the semester and you will have several days to complete along with a comprehensive final exam at the end of the semester.

* There will not be make-up exams given under any circumstances. Instead, the ‘weight’ of any missed exams will be moved to the cumulative final exam at the end of the semester.

* The final exam will be a cumulative and given during the University’s pre-determined final exam time.

**Note:** You will need to **scan** problem solving assignments and tests with your phone and **email them to me**. There are several different apps that make this convenient, my personal preference is the Genius Scan App. I will post the answers to problem solving assignments after the due date, thus no late homework assignments will be accepted or make-ups offered.

## Grading Policy:
A. Final grades will be determined based upon your attendance, performance on assignments, three in-class exams, and a comprehensive final exam using the following weights:
	
Problem solving assignments	36% (9*4%) \\
Writing assignments	12% (3*4%) \\
Exams 32% (2*16%)	\\	
Cumulative final exam	20%	\\		
Total Possible 100%	\\


B. Grades will be assigned based on the following scale: \\
A  100-94, A- 93-90, B+ 89-87, B  86-83, B- 82-80, C+ 79-77, C  76-73, C- 72-70, D+ 69-67, D  66-63, D- 62-60, F  59-0

## Attendance
This is an online / virtual course and attendance is not explicitly a part of the course grade. However, consistent engagement is important for performing well in the course.  

## Email Communications
Please use your ODU email address in order to correspond with me via email. I will only respond to ODU email accounts. Please put Econ 304 in the subject line. 

When you send me an email, use it as an opportunity to work on your formal written communication skills. Please do your best to compose a well-written and professional message, using complete sentences and correct grammar and punctuation. I might respond simply “Try again” for a poorly structured email. I am happy to answer questions, etc. however, I am interested in practicing professional communication.

## Academic Integrity
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.  In addition to imposing penalties ranging anywhere from a grade of F up to suspension, it is University policy to record all Academic Dishonesty convictions permanently on the student's transcript. I report all cases of academic dishonesty to the Office of Student Conduct for adjudication. 

## Withdrawals and Incomplete Grades:
Grades assigned for withdrawals are in strict compliance with university policies and an incomplete grade is only given in exceptional circumstances. See the University Schedule book for important dates regarding withdrawals. 

## Students with Disabilities:
Old Dominion University is committed to ensuring equal access to all qualified students with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Office of Educational Accessibility (OEA) is the campus office that works with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations.

If you experience a disability which will impact your ability to access any aspect of my class, please present me with an accommodation letter from OEA so that we can work together to ensure that appropriate accommodations are available to you.
	
If you feel that you will experience barriers to your ability to learn and/or testing in my class but do not have an accommodation letter, please consider scheduling an appointment with OEA to determine if academic accommodations are necessary.
