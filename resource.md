## How to make a pdf (for submitting assignments)
There are many good apps out there that will allow you to take photos and convert them to PDFs. The apps do a great job of optimizing your photos for PDFs (using your computer to convert will often result in very large PDF file sizes!). Here are a few apps you can use: 

Genius Scan, Turboscan, Image to PDF Converter Free, PDF Converter Pro, Simple Scan, etc.

Personally, I use Genius Scan. You can scan multiple pictures (think pages of your homework assignment) and send them all at once.
