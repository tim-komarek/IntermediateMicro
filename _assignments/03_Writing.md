Public choice refers to that area of economics devoted to the study of politics using the methods of economics. As in other applications of economics, a representative individual is the basic building block of public choice analysisâ€”in this case, a representative voter, politician, bureaucrat, regulator, or lobbyist. The individual is assumed to face a choice among alternatives, to have a preference among those alternatives, and to choose the alternative that is most consistent with his (or her) preference.
